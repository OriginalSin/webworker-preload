## webworker-preload [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/webworker-preload.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/webworker-preload)

_webworker-preload_ is a tool intended for advanced optimization purposes. It allows for preloading of resources such as javascript, CSS and image files using [Web Workers](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/workers/basics/). Preloading resources using web workers has several advantages for optimization, it is non-blocking (it utilizes resources from CPU's not used for rendering) and it allows for delayed execution of javascript.
